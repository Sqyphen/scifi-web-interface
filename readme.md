# Sci-fi web interface

## About

Futuristic computer systems and user interfaces always look over complex but allow the protagonist(s) to tap a couple of buttons and do everrything from hacking a security company to opening a door.

I want to make one.

So I'm using web technologies to keep it interactive but also familiar.
